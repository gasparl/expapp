This is a template project connected to the manuscript "[Creating Web Applications for Online Psychological Experiments: A Hands-On Technical Guide Including a Template](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/356k2)". It is intended as a template (template) for creating web applications for online psychological experiments via the HTML/CSS/JavaScript framework from scratch, without any additional software.

Here, [TUTORIAL.md](https://gasparl.github.io/expapp/docs/TUTORIAL.html) is the extended and open-source technical tutorial.

### Getting the scripts

The application can be downloaded or forked/cloned via Git. The simplest way is use the green "Clone or download" button on this page, chosing Download ZIP. After downloading, extract the zip file into a single folder.

### Contributions

Contributions are always very welcome both to the scripts and to the [tutorial](https://github.com/gasparl/expapp/blob/main/docs/TUTORIAL.md). When contributing to this repository:

- First discuss the change you wish to make via [issues](https://github.com/gasparl/expapp/issues "Issues") (or  via [email](https://gasparl.github.io/#contact));
- Keep the syle of your code consistent with that of the current one (indentation, ES6, etc.);
- Comment your the added code/functionalities thoroughly (keeping in mind that this is part of a tutorial);
- Test the entire app diligently to make sure that everything (still) works as it should.


#### Decision making

To choose what constitutes best practice, or at least good practice, to be implemented in the template (and/or noted in the open-source tutorial), the most important factor is empirical evidence from peer-reviewed research papers. In case of no empirical evidence, relevant web standard specifications (via [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) and/or [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)) may be accepted, unless there is reasonable evidence to the contrary (e.g., failing sanity checks or known bugs). In case none of these are applicable, the question should be discussed openly, under a corresponding GitHub issue, with the aim of reaching consensus. If no consensus can be reached, the final decision is made by the project [maintainer](https://gasparl.github.io/).
